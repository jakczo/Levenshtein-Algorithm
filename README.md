# Levenshtein-Algorithm
Implementation of the Levenshtein Algorithm in x86 Assembler (for multi-threaded use).

This repository contains a function that uses my implementation of the Levenshtein Algorithm (Levenshtein distance) used in the program to validate the entered word and/or DNA string. 

More information about the program and the algorithm itself are available in Polish language and can be found at this [link](https://github.com/jakczo/Autocorrection-Program "Autocorrection Program").
